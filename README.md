# CMPR131-Group-Work
A shared collaborative collection of the group work done for CMPR131

Above will be the various collabroative projects. If you have gitbash on your computer, or some sort of git management you can push and merge the commits when you are working done working on them. You cna also edit the code here in github. There is a workflow present in the repository that will check the code for vulnerbilities in the dependencies as well as in the code. These can be removed if they are causing issues. After a commit, it allows you to add a desription of your edit. If there are any issues with commits to the repository or with merges, it is possible to go back to previous versions.
